# Introduction

The algorithm that we have chosen are First Come First Serve(FCFS) algorithm, Shortest-Job-First(SJF) algorithm and Priority Scheduling. We chose all these algorithms because the algorithms is non-preemptive scheduling algorithm. Once the CPU is allocated to a process, the process holds the CPU until it gets terminated or it reaches a waiting state. 


# Consideration

We have considered that in class scheduling, when a class is started, there is no way that other classes could interfere the running class. The other class should wait until the running class to over so that the class could be in run. The running class should not be stopped to make other class to run.   


# Analysis

## FCFS

The First Come First Serve (FCFS) algorithm works where the process which arrives first, gets executed first. It is the same as the FIFO(First In First Out) queue in data structure where the data that is added first is the one who will leave first. We use the FCFS algorithm because in class scheduling, the course already be set by the Kulliyyah and the department. So as the course already be decided, some lecturers that are meant to teach in the morning should be in the class in the morning, and other lecturers could not interfere the class to teach his or her subject in the respective time.
